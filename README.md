Let us say you have a couple of great design ideas or products and would like to know which one your visitors think is the best. Another situation may be that you want trigger your visitors interest into an interaction which might make them give you their e-mail address, just like a lead generation tool. This is why this kind of voting plugin may come in handy on blog articles or landing pages. The clue is that as people click on a voting button, a popup opens with an incentive to sign up into a mailchimp e-mail list. This incentive may be for example the opportunity to win the selected design/product or anything else that may cause a strong enough interest to actually sign up. The plugin enables you to add up to 5 ideas and for each idea up to 2 images plus one image for the popup. Also the content of the popup can easily be customized.
